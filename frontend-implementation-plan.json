Each product must have a unique id (e.g., 'prod-001'), name, short description (1-2 sentences), numeric price, category string, rating value (0-5), and an image field (emoji or placeholder string). Ensure no duplicate product names exist. Maintain the existing data structure and do not modify the catalog UI layout, filtering, or sorting logic. Use realistic product names, prices, and descriptions appropriate for a tech/gadget e-commerce site."
